    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees. This approach helps improve the accuracy and robustness of the regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor reduces overfitting through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging Predictions: By averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees, it smooths out individual tree predictions and reduces variance, which helps mitigate overfitting.\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data (created by sampling with replacement). This process introduces diversity among the trees and helps generalize better to new data.\n",
    "Random Feature Selection: At each split in a tree, a random subset of features is considered. This prevents any single feature from dominating the decision-making process and further reduces overfitting.\n",
    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Multiple Trees: Each tree in the forest is trained on a different random subset of the training data, with a random subset of features considered at each split.\n",
    "Averaging Predictions: For regression, the final prediction is the average of the predictions made by all individual trees. This averaging process helps to smooth out individual tree predictions and reduce variance.\n",
    "Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "Key hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "\n",
    "n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest.\n",
    "max_depth: The maximum depth of each tree. If None, nodes are expanded until they contain fewer than min_samples_split samples.\n",
    "min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
    "bootstrap: Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. If False, the entire dataset is used to build each tree.\n",
    "oob_score: Whether to use out-of-bag samples to estimate the generalization accuracy.\n",
    "n_jobs: The number of jobs to run in parallel for both fit and predict. -1 means using all processors.\n",
    "Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "Decision Tree Regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Tree: Uses a single decision tree to make predictions.\n",
    "Overfitting: More prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.\n",
    "Simplicity: Easier to interpret, but may have high variance.\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble of Trees: Uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions.\n",
    "Reduced Overfitting: Aggregates multiple trees to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.\n",
    "Complexity: More complex and less interpretable compared to a single decision tree, but usually more accurate.\n",
    "Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust to Overfitting: Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree by averaging multiple trees.\n",
    "Handles Missing Values: Can handle missing values well and maintain accuracy.\n",
    "Feature Importance: Provides measures of feature importance, which can be useful for feature selection.\n",
    "Versatile: Can handle both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: More complex and less interpretable than a single decision tree.\n",
    "Computationally Intensive: Requires more computational resources and time compared to simpler models.\n",
    "Large Model Size: The model can become large with a large number of trees, requiring more memory.\n",
    "Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "The output of the Random Forest Regressor is the average of the predictions made by each individual decision tree in the forest. For a given input, the regressor returns a single continuous value, which is the mean of the predictions from all trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
    "While the primary use of Random Forest Regressor is for regression tasks, the Random Forest Classifier is used for classification tasks. The Random Forest Classifier works similarly but aggregates predictions based on majority voting (for classification problems), rather than averaging (for regression problems)."
